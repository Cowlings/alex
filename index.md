## Skills Summary

### Front-end development

I build websites using templating languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My strengths lie in mobile-first design implementations with robust, reusable and scalable front-end components. I am flexible with technology stack and platforms and have learned a few along the way including Jekyll, CraftCMS, Expression Engine, Sharepoint, dotnetnuke and more.  I also have experience building processes for quality code delivery.

### Business expertise

In addition to the value I contribute through implementing the technical solution for the stakeholder, I have a deep desire to meet the goals of a seamless user experience and delivering on business objectives. I enjoying work with cross disciplinary teams to develop solutions which focus on outcome rather than output.

I joined IVHQ during the rebuild of the marketing website and an internal Ruby on Rails application. I worked alongside the engineers which did the data migrations and infrastructure, and I was responsible for the front-end templating. Since the relaunch I’ve been involved in the rails application feature builds, redesign of marketing site components, A/B testing, mobile app wireframes, and building an additional website for our sister company, Intern Abroad HQ. The marketing site is built using popular JAMstack methodology. The static platform is built using Jekyll, which uses the Liquid templating language (popularised by Shopify) and SCSS, a CSS preprocessor. I’m also responsible for maintaining collaborative Javascript implementations in vanilla javascript and jQuery.
